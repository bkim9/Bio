I love [powershell](README.md).
In powershell, I can get content of a file with the command `Get-Content`, `get-content`, or even with just `gc`. 
## Education
1. Powershell
2. C++
3. C#
   
I studied powershell by myself when I am serving military in the ROK. I was fascinated by its simple and intuitive design. I had fun playing with it a lot. ~~Moreover, the limitted access to information there alowed me to practice only it.~~
## Sports
- Tennis
- Bicycles

High physical ability is required to do well on tests. I believe that I need to be healthier for my sustainable academic growth. My favorite sports is tennis and I also like riding bicycles.
I like playing tennis. I especially like practicing with hitting a wall in Rimac indoor court. It is refreshing to be alone in a big bright room. I can concentrate on myself there. Below is an image of my old racquet. ![it is an image of my old racquet it is leaning against a wall in my room](assets/oldracquet.jpg) this is my old racquet. Below is the new one I puchased with the support of the government for recreaion. They gave me 40% of the price.

I also like riding my bike. Since I don't have a car yet, it's the only transportation I have. Below is an image of my old bike I used to ride.

## Cooking
There is an economic reason for me cooking. It is really expensive for me to buy a food. I love cooking. I am feeling happy when I made some food smoothly. It gives me a feeling of achievement. I like using pork belly since it is cheaper here, plus it tastes good. I can get lard if I want. Recently, I am into baking. I went to *The Republic* in Los Angeles just before the quarter starts. It tastes so good that I decided to start baking. I baked a cake by learning with videos of how to make it. I am glad to say that my baking skill is improving. Personally, I love tresleches cake. I want to make it some day. I like challenging myself to test my own limits.
